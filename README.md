# Screenshot

A basic C# library that allows the user to create screenshots.

I wrote this library in university as part of my dissertation. A useful little
utility for taking screenshots either of a full screen or part of a screen.

The main class is the `Screenshot.Screenshot` class. There are several `Take()`
methods, each of which takes different parameters depending on what you want to
do (save to a file, screenshot a part of the screen, etc). All methods return
a copy of the screenshot as a bitmap.
